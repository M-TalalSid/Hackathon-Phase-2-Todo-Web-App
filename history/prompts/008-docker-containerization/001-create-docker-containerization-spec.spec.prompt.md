## Prompt

@[/sp.specify] Spec-8: Containerization & Image Intelligence (Docker + Gordon)

Objective:
Convert the Phase-3 Todo AI Chatbot into fully containerized, production-grade Docker images using AI-assisted tooling, ensuring reproducibility, security, and Kubernetes readiness.

This spec defines how frontend and backend services are containerized and validated prior to Kubernetes deployment.

---

Target Outcomes:

- Frontend and backend run as isolated Docker containers
- Images are minimal, secure, and reproducible
- No manual Dockerfile authoring
- Containers are ready for Helm + Kubernetes usage

---

Scope:

In-Scope:

- Frontend Docker image
- Backend Docker image
- Dockerfile generation using AI tools
- Local container validation
- Image optimization and hardening

Out-of-Scope:

- Kubernetes manifests
- Helm charts
- Cluster-level configuration

---

Mandatory Tooling:

- Docker Desktop
- Docker AI Agent (Gordon), when available
- No handwritten Dockerfiles

---

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for Docker containerization feature:

**Branch**: `008-docker-containerization`

**User Stories (4)**:

1. P1: Backend Container Runs Successfully
2. P2: Frontend Container Runs Successfully
3. P1: Dockerfiles Generated by AI
4. P3: Images Are Optimized and Minimal

**Requirements**:

- 12 Functional Requirements (FR-001 to FR-012)
- 4 Non-Functional Requirements (NFR-001 to NFR-004)

**Success Criteria (8)**:

- SC-001 to SC-008 covering build, runtime, security, and K8s readiness

**Quality Checklist**: All 16 items passed validation

Spec is ready for `/sp.plan` phase.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete containerization specification for Phase-4
- 🧪 Tests: N/A - specification document
- 📁 Files: Created `spec.md` and `checklists/requirements.md`
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan to create implementation plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Balanced detail with technology-agnostic requirements; Gordon fallback rule documented

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All checklist items validated
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Monitor if Gordon availability affects implementation
