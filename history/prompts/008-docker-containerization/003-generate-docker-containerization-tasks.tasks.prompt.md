## Prompt

@[/sp.tasks]

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task list for Docker containerization:

**File Created**: `specs/008-docker-containerization/tasks.md`

**Task Summary**:

| Category                     | Count |
| ---------------------------- | ----- |
| Total Tasks                  | 45    |
| Setup Phase                  | 5     |
| Foundational Phase           | 3     |
| User Story 1 (Backend)       | 8     |
| User Story 2 (Frontend)      | 9     |
| User Story 3 (AI Generation) | 5     |
| User Story 4 (Optimization)  | 7     |
| Polish Phase                 | 8     |
| Parallelizable Tasks         | 18    |

**User Stories Mapped**:

- US1: Backend Container Runs Successfully (P1) - MVP
- US2: Frontend Container Runs Successfully (P2)
- US3: Dockerfiles Generated by AI (P1)
- US4: Images Are Optimized and Minimal (P3)

**Independent Test Criteria**:

- US1: `curl localhost:7860/health` returns OK
- US2: Browser loads localhost:3000
- US3: Dockerfiles have AI generation comments
- US4: Image sizes under limits (500MB/300MB)

Ready for execution with `/sp.implement`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete executable task list for containerization
- 🧪 Tests: Not requested - test tasks omitted
- 📁 Files: Created `tasks.md`
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement to execute tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks organized by user story enable MVP-first delivery; parallel opportunities maximize efficiency

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All tasks follow checklist format
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Execute Phase 1 to validate Docker environment
