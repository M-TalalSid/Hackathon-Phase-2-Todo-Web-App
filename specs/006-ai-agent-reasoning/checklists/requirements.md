# Specification Quality Checklist: AI Agent Behavior & Tool-Oriented Reasoning

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-02-05  
**Feature**: [spec.md](file:///c:/Users/TALAL/Desktop/Phase-2-Hackathon/todo-web-app/specs/006-ai-agent-reasoning/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined (3 scenarios per user story)
- [x] Edge cases are identified (5 edge cases documented)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (Out of Scope section included)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (7 user stories)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes
